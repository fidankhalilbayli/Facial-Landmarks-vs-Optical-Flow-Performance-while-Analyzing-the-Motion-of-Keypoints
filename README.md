# Facial-Landmarks-vs-Optical-Flow-Performance-while-Analyzing-the-Motion-of-Keypoints
Link to demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-S0Pv8_TTI <br>
While detecting the face's motion estimation the following keypoints should be used:<br>
-Leftmost point of the left eye.<br>
-Righmost point of the right eye.<br>
-Tip of the nose.<br>
-Leftmost point of the lip.<br>
-Rightmost point of the lip.<br>
-Tip of the chin.<br>
As can be seen the Lucas Kanade Optical Flow method fails to provide valuable results while the objects' velocity is not small.
